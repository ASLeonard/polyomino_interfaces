## Binary polyomino self-assembly
Polyomimo lattice self-assembly model with binary string interfaces

### Core modules
Majority of polyomino core features are found in the `polyomino_core' submodule.

### Simulations
Polyomino evolutions are written in c++, with the accompanying analysis in python3

### Plotting
Visualing the outputs of the evolution are in various functions within the `interface_plotting' file in scripts
